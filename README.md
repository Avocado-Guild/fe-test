# Avocado Frontend Test
Create a simple decentralized application (dApp) using Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, viem and wagmi. The application will be a basic NFT viewer that allows users to connect their wallet and view their owned NFTs on the Ethereum mainnet.

## Requirements
- Use Next.js with TypeScript for the project setup
- Implement responsive design using TailwindCSS and/or shadcn/ui
- Integrate with Ethereum mainnet using wagmi and viem for web3 functionality
- Implement wallet connection functionality
- Fetch and display a list of NFTs owned by the connected wallet from Ethereum mainnet
- Create a detail view for individual NFTs to show the metadata

**BONUS:**
  - Implemenet UI to switch network if the user is not on the Ethereum mainnet
  - On the NFT detail view/page, display the NFT's past transfers information (a list of recent transfers)

## Evaluation Criteria

We will be assessing your submission based on the following criteria:

**Code Quality and Organization:**
- Clean, readable, and well-structured code
- Proper use of components and hooks in React/Next.js
- Effective state management
- Adherence to TypeScript best practices

**Technical Proficiency:**
- Correct implementation of Next.js features (e.g., server-side rendering, API routes if used)
- Proper integration and use of web3 libraries (wagmi, viem)
- Effective fetching and handling of NFT data from Ethereum mainnet
- Appropriate use of TailwindCSS for styling

**User Experience and Interface Design:**
- Intuitive and responsive UI design
- Smooth user interactions and transitions
- Proper handling of loading states and errors

**Performance Optimization:**
- Efficient rendering and re-rendering of components
- Appropriate use of Next.js performance features (e.g., Image component, dynamic imports)

**Documentation and Code Comments:**
- Clear README with setup instructions and project overview
- Well-commented code explaining complex logic or decisions

**Attention to Detail:**
- Handling of edge cases and error states
- Consistent coding style and formatting

**Completeness:**
- Implementation of all or most required features
- Prioritization of core functionality if time was limited

**Creativity and Initiative:**
- Any additional features or improvements beyond the basic requirements
- Innovative solutions to problems encountered during development

Remember, while we encourage you to showcase your skills across all these areas, we understand the time constraint. Focus on delivering a functional application that demonstrates your strengths as a frontend developer.

## Submission Guidelines

  1. Create a new GitHub public repository for the project.
  2. Include a README.md with:
      - Project setup instructions
      - Any assumptions or design decisions made
      - List of third-party libraries used and why (feel free to use any other libraries of your liking)
  3. Deploy the application to a free hosting service (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).
  4. **Submit the GitHub repository URL and the deployed application URL.**

We're excited to see your approach to this challenge! Remember, we're not just looking for a perfect implementation, but also for your problem-solving skills, code organization, and creativity. Don't hesitate to make design decisions where the requirements are open-ended, and feel free to add any extra features if time allows.

If you encounter any issues or have questions about the requirements, please don't hesitate to reach out for clarification. We want you to have the best opportunity to showcase your skills.

Take a deep breath, trust in your abilities, and most importantly, enjoy the process. We're looking forward to seeing your unique solution!
